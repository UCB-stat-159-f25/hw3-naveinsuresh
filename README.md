The objective of this repo is to incorporate increased modularization, testing, pip installations, myst builds, and github pages utilizations for the LOSC computational data project. This repo builds from the work done in homework 2, which was focused more on constructing proper environments and binder links. Datasets and output files are also properly organized into directories, unlike in hw2.
